# Question

Say we have an app with `Dog` and `Toy` models, where toys belong to dogs and
dogs have many toys. Which of the following will correctly create a new toy and
associate it with the dog with an `id` of 2?

## Correct

```rb
Toy.create(name: "Squeaky Cheeseburger", dog_id: 2)
```

> Correct! We can use the `dog_id` foreign key directly when creating a new toy.

## Correct

```rb
dog = Dog.find(2)
Toy.create(name: "Squeaky Cheeseburger", dog: dog)
```

> Yes indeed! We can create a new new `Toy` instance and associate it with the
> correct dog by providing a `Dog` instance, so long as we have the
> `belongs_to: :dog` method set up in the `Toy` model.

## Correct

```rb
dog = Dog.find_by(id: 2)
dog.toys << Toy.create(name: "Squeaky Cheeseburger")
```

> Right! We can create a new new `Toy` instance and associate it with the correct dog
> by using the shovel operator, so long we have set up the `has_many :toys`
> method on the `Dog` class.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
