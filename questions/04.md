# Question

Say we have an app with `Dog` and `Toy` models, where toys belong to dogs and
dogs have many toys. Which SQL table should contain the foreign key?

## Correct

`toys`

> Yes! In our model, toys belong to dogs so the `toys` table should contain the
> `dog_id` foreign key.

## Incorrect

`dogs`

> Not quite! In our model, toys belong to dogs so the `toys` table should
> contain the `dog_id` foreign key.

## Incorrect

It's necessary to create a join table.

> This is a one-to-many association, so we don't need a join table.

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
