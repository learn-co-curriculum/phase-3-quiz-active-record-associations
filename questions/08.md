# Question

Say we have a many-to-many relationship among `Doctor`, `Patient` and
`Appointment`  
models, where a doctor has many patients through appointments and vice versa.

When setting up the Active Record associations in the `Doctor` model, we  
**must** specify its relationship with `Appointment` **before** we can specify  
its relationship with `Patient`.

## Correct

True

> Yes! The association with Appointment&nbsp;needs to be set up before we can set up an association **through** &nbsp;it

## Incorrect

False

> Not quite! The association with Appointment&nbsp;needs to be set up before we can set up an association **through** it.

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
