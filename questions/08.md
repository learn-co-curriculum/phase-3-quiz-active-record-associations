# Question

Say we have used Active Record to set up a many-to-many relationship among
`Teacher`, `Student` and `Course` models, such that a teacher has many students
through courses and vice versa.

Given the following code in the `Teacher` model:

```rb
class Teacher < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :courses
  has_many :students, through: :courses
end
```

What instance methods will be available on a teacher instance? Select all that
apply.

## Incorrect

`#course`

> Not quite. Remember, a teacher **has many** courses.

## Correct

`#courses`

> Yes! Using the `has_many :courses` method will create a `#courses` instance
> method.

## Incorrect

`#student`

> Not quite. Remember, a teacher **has many** students.

## Correct

`#students`

> Yes! Using the `has_many :students` method will create a `#students` instance
> method.
