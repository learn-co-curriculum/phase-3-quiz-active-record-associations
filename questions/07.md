# Question

Say we have a many-to-many relationship among `Doctor`, `Patient` and  
`Appointment` models, where a doctor has many patients through appointments and
vice versa.

When setting up the Active Record associations in the `Doctor` model, we  
**must** specify its relationship with `Appointment` **before** we can specify  
its relationship with `Patient`.

## Correct

True

> Yes! The association with Appointment needs to be set up before we can set up
> an association **through** it. In other words, this code will not work:
>
> ```rb
> class Doctor < ActiveRecord::Base
>   has_many :patients, through: :appointments
>   has_many :appointments
> end
> ```
>
> But this will:
>
> ```rb
> class Doctor < ActiveRecord::Base
>   has_many :appointments
>   has_many :patients, through: :appointments
> end
> ```

## Incorrect

False

> Not quite! The association with Appointment needs to be set up before we can
> set up an association **through** it. In other words, this code will not work:
>
> ```rb
> class Doctor < ActiveRecord::Base
>   has_many :patients, through: :appointments
>   has_many :appointments
> end
> ```
>
> But this will:
>
> ```rb
> class Doctor < ActiveRecord::Base
>   has_many :appointments
>   has_many :patients, through: :appointments
> end
> ```

## Incorrect
