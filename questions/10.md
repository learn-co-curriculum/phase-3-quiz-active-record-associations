# Question

Say we have used Active Record to set up a many-to-many relationship among
`Teacher`, `Student` and `Course` models, such that a teacher has many students
through courses and vice versa.

Given the following code in the `Course` model:

```rb
class Course < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :student
  belongs_to :teacher
end
```

What instance methods will be available on a course instance? Select all that
apply.

## Correct

> method.
